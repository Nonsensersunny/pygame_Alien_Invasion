# Alien Invasion

Inspired by pygame in ***Python Crash Course***, I imitated the game and optimized some details including self-customized configuration, score record and alien movement adjustment.

-----

## Getting started

* Install pygame in terminal

```bash
pip install pygame
```

* game.ini

```ini
# Configure the size of screen
[screenSize]
width = 1000
height = 600
# Configure the background of the game
[bgColor]
r = 230
g = 230
b = 230
# Configure the size of the game
[buttonStyle]
width = 200
height = 50
# Reset the record
[gameRecord]
highest = 92016
hest = 86958
```

## Try the game

```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```
